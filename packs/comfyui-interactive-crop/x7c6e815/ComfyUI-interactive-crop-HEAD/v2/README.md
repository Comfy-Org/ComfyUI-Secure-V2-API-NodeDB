# Interactive Crop for ComfyUI

![preview image of node, showing how it looks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ugleh/ComfyUI-interactive-crop/refs/heads/main/preview.png?raw=true)

An **interactive, run-pausing** crop node for ComfyUI.

Unlike most crop nodes (which crop from numeric inputs), this node lets you **draw the selection during the prompt run** and then choose what to do:

- **Apply Crop / Skip** (crop if a selection exists, otherwise passthrough)
- **Cancel Run** (interrupt processing)

Because it waits for you, this node is intended for **human-in-the-loop** workflows.

## ✨ What is this?

Interactive Crop displays a live preview inside the node and lets you drag out a crop rectangle directly on the image. When the graph reaches the node, execution **pauses** until you make a decision.

Use it for:

- Quick visual framing / composition tweaks
- Cropping “just right” before downstream steps (upscales, detailers, inpaint/outpaint)
- Optional “crop or skip” branches using the `did_crop` boolean output

## 🎨 Features

- **Interactive selection**: click-drag to draw a crop rectangle on the preview.
- **Move selection**: click inside the rectangle and drag to reposition.
- **Run-time decision**: crop, passthrough (skip), or cancel the run.
- **Aspect lock (optional)**: constrain the rectangle to the original image aspect ratio.
- **Resize-back (optional)**: resize the cropped output back to the original resolution (bilinear).

## 📦 Installation

Clone this repository into your ComfyUI `custom_nodes` folder:

```bash
cd <COMFYUI_ROOT>/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/Ugleh/ComfyUI-interactive-crop.git
```

Your folder should look like:

```text
ComfyUI/
└── custom_nodes/
		└── ComfyUI-interactive-crop/
				├── __init__.py
				├── interactive_crop.py
				├── js/
				│   └── interactive_crop.js
				└── README.md
```

Restart ComfyUI to load the new node.

There are no extra Python dependencies.

## 🧪 Basic usage

1. Add **Interactive Crop** (category: `image`).
2. Connect an image source to the `image` input.
3. Queue / run the workflow.
4. When execution reaches the node, it will show a preview and wait.
5. Use the mounted preview directly, then:
   - **Draw a crop**: click-drag on the preview.
   - **Move the crop**: drag inside the existing rectangle.
6. Click **Apply Crop / Skip**:
   - If a valid selection exists: outputs the cropped image.
   - If no/too-small selection exists: outputs the original image (skip).
7. Optional: click **Cancel Run** to interrupt the prompt.

### Node I/O

- **Inputs**
	- `image` (IMAGE)
	- `force_original_ratio` (BOOLEAN): locks selection to the input image aspect ratio (live toggle while active)
	- `resize_to_original` (BOOLEAN): resizes the cropped result back to the original width/height
- **Outputs**
	- `image` (IMAGE)
	- `did_crop` (BOOLEAN): `true` only when a valid crop was applied

## ⚠️ Known limitations / behavior notes

- **Not for unattended runs**: the graph pauses until you respond.
- **Timeout**: after 4 minutes with no input the interaction expires and the node errors.
- **Batch input**: the preview/selection is based on the first image in the batch; the same crop is applied to every image.
- **Selection is not required**: the mounted preview owns its pointer gestures,
  so cropping cannot also drag the graph node underneath it.
- **Managed preview**: the host creates and serves the temporary preview; the node never receives a filesystem path.

## 💬 Notes

This node is intentionally interactive. If your workflow is meant to run headlessly (e.g. overnight queues), you’ll likely want a standard coordinate-based crop node instead.
