"""The project layer's two graph nodes.

Execution-model reality: the thing that feeds the sampler (context) and the
thing that records its result cannot be one node without a cycle, so the
layer is a source and a sink around the existing chain:

    H3 Project Hub -> H3 Context -> sampler -> decode -> Trim
                                                           -> H3 Project Save

The Hub resolves the manifest into this run's inputs: the approved tail's
latent (video AND audio context now come from it), a chain_active flag that
drives H3 Context's `enabled` passthrough (killing the clip-1 bypass ritual),
and a project handle. Project Save writes the (mp4, safetensors) pair as one
atomic unit named by the manifest and appends the pending entry. Approve /
re-roll / reject live on the manifest via the HTTP routes; the next queue
press re-resolves because IS_CHANGED hashes the manifest.
