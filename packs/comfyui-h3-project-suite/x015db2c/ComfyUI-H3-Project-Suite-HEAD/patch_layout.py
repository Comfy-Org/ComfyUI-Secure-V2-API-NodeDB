"""Lift MiniMax H3's first/last-only keyframe anchor restriction.

Stock ComfyUI builds keyframe conditioning rows at one of two time
coordinates and rejects everything else:

    if pixel_index == 0:
        cond_t = float(text_len)
    elif frame_count is not None and pixel_index == frame_count - 1:
        cond_t = float(text_len) + sum(_video_t_spans(latent_t)) - FRAME_RESCALE
    else:
        raise ValueError("only first/last keyframe anchors are supported")

Both branches are the same expression. Each video token spans
FRAME_RESCALE * FRAME_PER_TOKEN[k % 5] and covers FRAME_PER_TOKEN[k % 5]
pixel frames, so the cumulative time at pixel frame p is exactly
FRAME_RESCALE * p, for every p. Substituting p = frame_count - 1
reproduces the second branch identically:

    text_len + FRAME_RESCALE * (frame_count - 1)
      == text_len + FRAME_RESCALE * frame_count - FRAME_RESCALE
      == text_len + sum(_video_t_spans(latent_t)) - FRAME_RESCALE

So the general position is:

    cond_t = text_len + FRAME_RESCALE * pixel_index

We do NOT rewrite the source of PackedLayout.__init__. Instead every
keyframe is handed to stock code with resolved_frame_index = 0, which is
always legal, and the real index rides along under MC_KEY. After the
stock constructor returns we rewrite the time column of each cond
segment's rows in position_ids. RoPE is built at forward time from
position_ids, so this lands before anything reads it.

That keeps the patch surface to one attribute we can verify rather than a
copy of a 90-line constructor that would rot on the next ComfyUI change.

    Refs and keyframes carry identical row machinery; what makes the model
    read a ref as "a separate clip to imitate" rather than "this clip,
    continued" is that its coordinates sit in a span before the target.
    That distinction decided continuation vs reproduction for video, and
    seam analysis showed the audio ref producing phase-unlocked imitation.
    So: keep the audio on the ref path for construction and payload (rows
    built, latents filled, all stock code untouched) and TRANSLATE its
    time coordinates so the window END lands at target frame
    MC_AUDIO_KEY -- the same instant the pinned video ends.

    Translation, not per-row assignment: new = old + shift preserves
    whatever intra-block structure stock built (row order, the rows-per-
    step factor, fractional offsets), so nothing about the block's
    internals is assumed.

    The ref still advances the layout cursor, so its old coordinate slot is
    left VACANT after the move. An audio
    window longer than the video window therefore spills backwards into
    empty coordinate space rather than onto the text rows -- the collision
    that made `before` mode fail for video does not arise here.

    Row selection is by coordinate range (the vacated slot), excluding
    cond segments explicitly so a stock first-frame keyframe sitting at
    text_len can never be swept up regardless of fixup order.

    Multi-ref support here is based on the compatibility patch contributed by
    seitanism in the Banodoco MiniMax H3 seamless-extension thread.
    Ordinary Ref2VA blocks may precede the marked Motion Context audio ref.
    The marked block must be last: the node appends it after the incoming
